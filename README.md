## Tech Stack
- Backend = Python-Flask
    - Database = Local Pickle Files per User Session
- Frontend = HTML / CSS
- Hosted with Heroku

## Code Organization
- **static** --> contains CSS styling
- **templates** --> contains all HTML pages
- **app.py** --> main code logic
- **Procfile** --> required for Heroku
- **requirements.txt** --> list of package versions
- **runtime.txt** --> required for Heroku
- **SetupData** --> Class to build Pandas Dataframes from Spotify API
- **visualization.py** --> Class to build Pages and pickle Plotly graphs

## Workflow

1. Activate Python Virtual Environment - env\scripts\activate
2. Test Locally - flask run
3. Troubleshooting
    - Delete .data and .flask_session folders if cannot sign out
4. Uploading to Heroku
    - Change REDIRECT_URI in app.py and SetupData.py to Heroku URL


## Known Bugs
1. Top 50 %s may not be even if the API grabs less than the Top 50 songs (for example it has only grabbed 29 songs)
