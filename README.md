## Tech Stack
- **Overview**
    - Backend = Python-Flask
    - Frontend = HTML / CSS
    - Hosted with Heroku
- **Streaming Data Collection**
    - Given Spotify API token, render_template setup.html in app.py
    - In JavaScript for setup.html, create EventSource for route setup_#
        - Use source.onmessage function to add streamed data to setup.html
    - In route setup_1, return Response with Generator Function and text/event-stream
    - In Generator Function, yield "data:" + streamed-data + "\n\n"
- **Dataframe Schema**
    - ALL_SONGS_DF
        - id
        - name
        - artist = String separated by commas
        - artist_ids = String separated by commas
        - album
        - explicit
        - popularity
        - playlist = User Playlist Name
        - added_at = String not Date
        - duration
        - genres = LIST of LISTS
    - UNIQUE_SONGS_DF
        - groups ALL_SONGS_DF by name and artist
        - playlist becomes playlists = separated by commas
        - added_at = separated by commas
        - songfeature_percentile = percentile across all songs in the dataframe
            - popularity, danceability, energy, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, duration
        - num_playlists = integer
        - artists_short_rank = INT or "N/A" if single, STR separated by commas if multiple
            - med, long
        - songs_short_rank = INT or "N/A"
            - med, long
- **Frontload Data Collection & Querying**
    - Pickle Library = Dump and Load Python Objects in Local File Storage
    - Before letting the user explore the pages - make queries, draw graphs, and pickle those graphs so the pages can be quickly loaded without having to do the same work again
    - Sign_Out will delete all files, and Heroku does so automatically after the User Session

## Code Organization
- **static** --> contains CSS styling
- **templates** --> contains all HTML pages
- **app.py** --> main code logic
- **Procfile** --> required for Heroku
- **requirements.txt** --> list of package versions
- **runtime.txt** --> required for Heroku
- **SetupData** --> Class to build Pandas Dataframes from Spotify API
- **visualization.py** --> Class to build Pages and pickle Plotly graphs

The following folders are dynamically created while running the app:
- **.data** --> save .pkl graphs per Spotify User ID
- **.flask_session** --> save session ID
- **.sp_caches** --> save cache token for the SP object
- **.spotify_caches** --> save cache token for the SPOTIFY object

## Workflow
1. Activate Python Virtual Environment - env\scripts\activate
2. Test Locally - flask run
3. Troubleshooting
    - Delete .data .flask_session .spotify_caches .cache before running
    - heroku logs --tail
4. Heroku Setup
    - pip install gunicorn
    - pip freeze > requirements.txt
    - Procfile / Runtime Files
5. Uploading to Heroku
    - Change REDIRECT_URI in app.py and SetupData.py to Heroku URL
    - heroku login
    - heroku git:remote -a spotify-statys
    - git add/commit
    - git push heroku master
    - heroku open
6. Pulling from Heroku
    - Install Heroku CLI
    - heroku login
    - heroku git:clone -a spotify-statys
    - env\scripts\activate
    - pip install -r requirements.txt

## Updates
- **Known Bugs**
    1. Top 50 - Last 4 Weeks - % of Top 50 Artists (bottom graph) will not always grab the full 50 artists = usually only the top 29 or 30. 
    2. Today's Date = a day ahead sometimes
- **Future Features**
    1. Collect Liked Songs and Include in All Graphs
    2. Search Autocomplete
    3. Styling
    4. Mobile Responsiveness
